SDLC -> Software Development Lifecycle





Stages:
1)Requirement Gathering:
Types of Requirement:

1)Functional Requirement:

2)Non Functional Requirement:

->Diagrams,Tables
UML -> Unified Modeling Language

2)Analysis
3)Design
4)Implementation->coding->developer
5)Testing->Tester
6)Maintenance->Production
Types of Maintenance:
1)Corrective : You Need to Correct Some Errors.

2)Adaptive : Product is already available on one platform you will 
develop for another platform.

3)Perfective : if you want to make the application more perfective
at that time you can follow perfective Maintenance
