7 key Princi:

1.Testing Shows Presence of Defects
identify - There are some defects
not identify - There are no defects- currently it's error free

Why we are doing testing?
->reduce the probability of undiscovered defects

2.Exhaustive Testing is impossible
-> it's not possible to check every input condition 
-> every combination of input are not check to possible

3. Early Testing
-> documentation testing
-> Parallel

4. Defect Clustering
-> defects are not evenly spread in a system
-> from one defect another defect should not affect

5. The Pesticide Paradox
-> Regularly Review and Revised Something to find some new defects

6. Testing is context dependent
-> Every Webiste needs to check diffrently

7. Absence of Error Fallacy
-> There is no Error
-> Requirement also not fullfilled

Project Based
-> it works on client budget
-> You Need Customers

Product Based 
-> Own Budget
-> Product Work
